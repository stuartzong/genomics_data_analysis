# genomics_data_analysis
This is my script collection while working at Micheal Smith Genome Science Centre Canada. I had the opportunity of working on a wide range of next generation sequencing data including: genome, transcriptome, epigenome etc. 

Analyses performed include: somatic variants, copy number, RNA expression, chipseq histone modification, microbial integration, cancer microenvironment including T cell receptor repertoire, immune cell abundance, neoantigen prediction.
